The Admin Landing Page hosts two functions:
1. Delete stale choices
2. Generate report of choices

To delete stale choices, simply input the lifespan (in days) you would consider too old for a choice, and click the delete. Upon refresh, the choices will be removed.

To generate the report of choices, simply click the generate report button, and see a formatted table containing the data of all choices to be displayed.

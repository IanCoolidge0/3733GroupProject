The Admin Landing Page serves two purposes:
1. Generate report
2. Delete stale choices

Generate report generates a list of all choices that are currently in the database and displays them in table format.

Delete stale choices takes the input amount of time, and deletes all choices from the database that are older than that upon the click of the button.
